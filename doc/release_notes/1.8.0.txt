* When using a browser, Rodauth now uses an appropriate 401, 403,
  or 422 error status for errors instead of using 200 success status.
  Many configuration methods have been added to customize the status
  codes used for specific types of errors.

* The json_response_custom_error_status? configuration method
  has been added to the jwt feature, which if set to true makes
  the jwt feature use the same error status codes for JSON API
  requests that it would use for browser requests.  For backward
  compatibility, the default is to continue to use the 400
  error status for all errors in the JSON API, but this will
  change in Rodauth 2.
