= New Features

* A disallow_common_passwords feature has been added.  This feature
  by default will disallow the 10,000 most common passwords:

    enable :disallow_common_passwords

  You can supply your own file containing common passwords separated
  by newlines ("\n"):

    most_common_passwords_file '/path/to/file'

  You can also supply a password dictionary directly as any object
  that responds to include?:

    most_common_passwords some_password_dictionary_object

  The reason only the 10,000 most common passwords are used by
  default is larger password files would significantly bloat the
  size of the gem.  Also, because the most common passwords are kept
  in memory by default for performance reasons, larger password
  files can bloat the memory usage of the process (the
  disallow_common_passwords feature should use around 500KB of
  memory by default).  For very large password dictionaries,
  consider using a custom object that does not keep all common
  passwords in memory.
  
= Other Improvements

* Rodauth no longer uses the Rack::Request#[] method to get
  parameter values.  This method is deprecated in Rack 2.
