= New Features

* flash_error_key and flash_notice_key configuration methods have
  been added for setting the keys used in the flash hash.

* A confirm_password_redirect_session_key configuration method was
  added for configuring the session key used for storing the
  confirm password redirect.

= Other Improvements

* Support for the new Roda sessions plugin has been added. Rodauth
  now recognizes the :sessions_convert_symbols Roda application option
  and will default to using string keys instead of symbol keys for
  session and flash values if the application option is set.

= Backwards Compatibility

* If the :sessions_convert_symbols Roda application option is used,
  and the jwt feature is used and the jwt_symbolize_deeply?
  configuration method is not used, then the session data will not
  have the top-level data converted to symbols.

* If the Roda application defines a clear_session method in the scope,
  that method is now called by Rodauth to clear the session data. This
  is for better integration with the Roda sessions plugin.
