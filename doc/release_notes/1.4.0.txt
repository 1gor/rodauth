= New Features

* A update_password_hash feature has been added, which will update
  the password hash for the account whenever the account's current 
  password hash has a cost different from the currently configured
  password hash cost.

  This allows you to increase the password hash cost for all
  accounts or for certain types of accounts, and have the password
  hashes automatically updated to use the new cost the next time the
  correct password is provided for the account.
