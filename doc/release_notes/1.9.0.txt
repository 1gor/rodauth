= New Features

* Roda.precompile_rodauth_templates has been added.  This method
  allows for precompiling the templates that rodauth uses, which
  allows for memory saving when using a forking webserver that
  preloads the application, and also allows Rodauth to be used
  with an application that uses chroot after loading.

= Improvements

* If requesting a password reset link more than once, the same
  password reset key will be used.  Previously, subsequent
  emails after the first request would contain an invalid key,
  so if the email for the original request was lost, you could
  not generate another key until that key expired.
