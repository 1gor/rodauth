= New Features

* A login_maximum_length configuration method has been added.  This
  defaults to 255, and rodauth will now show an error message if a
  user tries to create a login longer than this setting.

= Backwards Compatibility

* Rodauth's documentation and test code now use :Bignum instead of
  Bignum for database-independent 64-bit integer types.  This is
  because using Bignum is now deprecated in Sequel as it will stop
  working correctly in ruby 2.4+, due to the unification of Fixnum
  and Bignum into Integer.

  Rodauth's library code does not use either :Bignum or Bignum, but if
  you are starting to use Rodauth and are copying the example
  migration from Rodauth's documentation, or you are running the
  migrations in Rodauth's tests, you now need to use Sequel 4.35.0+.

* Some files related to the hosting of the demo site on Heroku have
  been removed from the repository.
