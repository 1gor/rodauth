= New Features

* The rodauth plugin now supports :csrf=>false and :flash=>false
  options. This will make it so it no longer depends on the csrf
  or flash plugins, which is useful when the csrf and flash
  functionality is provided via a different approach, such as
  when rodauth is being used inside middleware in a Rails
  application with the roda-rails library.
