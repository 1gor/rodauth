= Documentation for Verify Change Login Feature

The verify change login feature implements account reverification after
change login.  Any time you use the verify account and change login
features together, you should probably use this, otherwise it is trivial
for users to work around account verification by creating an account with
an email address they control, and the changing the login to an email
address they don't control.  Depends on the change login and verify
account grace period features.
